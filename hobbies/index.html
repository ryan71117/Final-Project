    <p> I have many things that I do in my free time. Some of which 
      involve video games, watching movies, or even running. 
      I have been playing video games for a long time, and I have 
      always loved to play them with my friends. I don’t really have a
      specific game that I enjoy playing with them the most. All I
      really care about is having fun and laughing it up with some 
      good friends. I don’t just play games with my friends, sometimes 
      I enjoy playing games on my own. Some of those games consist of 
      Skyrim or various Pokemon games. Since I have been consistently
      running for a while now, it has become habit, and I am starting
      to run more on my own. It keeps me in shape, and gives
      me something to do. I’m also in shape enough already to 
      participate in various races, such as a 5k or a half marathon.
      When I’m not running, playing video games, or actually being
      productive, you can find me spending time with friends. I 
      always love spending time with my friends, and I do it quite
      often. As time goes on, I am slowly finding more things to
      do on my own time. Ironically I still find myself bored when 
      I have some many things to do, and hobbies to keep up with.
