    <p> Ever since I started school, I have been a fairly good student.
      I pay attention, I do my work, I get good grades, etc. It usually
      just comes easy to me. The teacher would put something on the board, and I 
      would just understand it. I never really needed to study or ask questions. 
      I was pretty fortunate to just understand these things. However, as 
      time went on, the subjects got tougher (as expected) and I started to see the need
      to study more. I wasn't exactly fond of this, I would much rather spend time doing other things.
      However, it was probably time that I started some better habits. They would
      help me in the future. So I did exactly that. I tried to ask more questions or to get help
      when I needed it, and it certainly helped. I started to study more, and the results showed it.
      I have been able to maintain about a 3.9 Accumulative GPA and I am finally at the final
      push. graduation is just aroudn the corner. I have been accepted into college, I have survived all these years. 
      All I have left to do now, is finish.
