      <p> To be totally be honest, I never really got into clubs all 
         that much while at Riley High School. I still participate in
         some clubs, but I mainly focused on sports because it took up
         most of my time. I mean, I did pretty much run year-round.
         I did still attempt to participate in clubs. My freshamn year,
         I joined Science Olympiad in an attempt to try something new 
         and explore outside of sports. WHile it is a great program at 
         Riley, it just wasn't really meant for me and I ended up leaving
         it 2 weeks after joining. I didn't really make attempt to join 
         a club after that until Junior year when NHS (National Honors Society)
         came to my attention. I figured it was really important for me to 
         join NHS becuase it would look good on my resume and college applications.
         I filled out the paper work to join, the teachers went through all of
         applications, and I ended up being accepteds as a member into the NHS.
         When in the Nhs, we mainly volunteered for various activities, such
         as Relay for Life, fundraising events, etc. All you have to do is
         volunteer for a total of 24 hours by the end of the school year, 
         and you stay in teh "club." It was super easy, and I kind of 
         enjoyed doing it. Though I didn't have much involvement in clubs at Riley,
         I still would recommend doing as much as you can while in high school.
