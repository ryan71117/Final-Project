    <p> I’ve known for a long time now that I wanted to go to college. The only issue was 
      that I didn’t know what I wanted to study, nor did I know where 
      I wanted to go. I didn’t really have an idea until I entered high
      school. That was because I joined the engineering magnet at Riley High 
      School, and I really enjoyed it. I decided I wanted to study a engineering. 
      Step 1 was done. Now to figure out what type of engineering. They offer
      various types of engineering classes at Riley and I wanted to take a few
      for the general knowledge, and to narrow down the list of what I wanted 
      to do. My favorite class was DE (Digital Electronics). I just really 
      enjoyed everything we did in there from learning boolean algebra to 
      wiring circuits. I decided to try to be an electrical/electronic engineer. I did some
      research on various colleges and ended up applying to 5 different universities.
      I applied to Purdue, Notre Dame, Rose-Hulman, Trine, and CU Boulder. I was accepted into
      CU Boulder (Exploratory Studies), Purdue (College of Liberal Arts),
      Trine (Electrical Engineering), and Rose-Hulman (Electrical Engineering). After a
      lot of evaluating, and college visits to a few of the colleges, I
      decided to go to Purdue. Why did I decide on Purdue when I wanted 
      to go into college for electrical engineering, but was accepted 
      into the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue? Well, when I visited 
      Purdue I had an opportunity to meet with one of the counselors. We 
      talked and at one point, he asked me about the classes I took, and 
      which ones I enjoyed. I answered and and he eventually recommended 
      majoring in Industrial Design. He explained what it was and I was 
      very intrigued. After lots of thought on every aspect of the colleges 
      (Location, Major, etc.), that is when I decided to attend Purdue. 
      I am very excited to attend Purdue with several of my classmates, 
      and I am also excited to see where the road takes me.
