      <p> My name is Ryan Phelan. At the time that I am creating this (5/15/19), I am
        attending James Whitcomb Riley High School. People consider me a very respectful and kind person.
        However, I have a goofy side that everyone seems to enjoy. I work hard, and take many
        things seriously, like sports. I am the captain of the distance
        crew on the Track & Field team, and I was also captain of the Cross Country team.
        I am also a member of the National Honors Society here at Riley. After high
        school, I plan on attending Purdue University, West Lafayette. While at Purdue, I will
        be majoring in Industrial Design. I don't really know what I will be doing after college.
        I could change majors, which would affect that dramatically. Either way, I'm excited for
        where the road takes me.
